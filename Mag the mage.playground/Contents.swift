 ### About me:
 In my life I have been through extremely difficult times, be it family problems or bad choices. But one thing that I have realized and that seems to be my strength is trying to keep myself happy even in the most difficult times. This is my magic and it is she that I want to share with everyone. Even though I can not change anyone's life, I can at least bring a smile or a hassle-free moment.
 I hope that in the future I will be able to make everyone discover their own magic.
 
 \
 **Goal:** just enjoy yourself with this game and survive in the maximum time you can ðŸ˜€
 
 - Important:
 For best experience play in landscape mode
 
 all the assets were made by me
